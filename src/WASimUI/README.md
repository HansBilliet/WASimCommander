## WASimUI - Desktop Application Companion for Testing and Exploring WASimCommander Features

This directory contains a full-featured GUI application which makes use of all available features of the WASimCommander Client API.
Primarily designed for testing the WASimCommander system, it also includes many usability features designed for "real world" use to
examine running Simulator state.

The GUI uses portions of the [_Qt Library_](http://qt.io) under the terms of the GPL v3 license.

Building requires MSVS (2019 or 2022) with Qt VSTools extention and a recent Qt v5 installation (tested with `5.12.12`, `5.14.2`). Qt v6 is _not_ supported.
