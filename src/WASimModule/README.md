## WASimModule - MSFS WASM Module Server Component

This directory contains the implementation of the WASM module code and the MSFS project used to build the final distribution package.

The built version of the module should be placed into the MSFS2020 _Community_ folder.  The folder `wasimcommander-module` and all its contents
can simply be dragged and dropped into place.
