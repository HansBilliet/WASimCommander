## Basic Console Test for C++

This directory contains a simple console-based application for testing and demonstrating `WASimClient` API usage in a C++ program.

It is set up for Visual Studio 2019, but can also be built with VS2022 (v143) with or w/out retargeting it.  Other compilers have not been tested yet.

This project depends on the `WASimClient` project.  The resulting executable is standalone (if built with static linking to `WASimClient`).
