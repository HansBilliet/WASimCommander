# WASimCommander
## Basic Console Test for C#

This directory contains a simple console-based application for testing and demonstrating `WASimClient` API usage in managed C# code.

It is set up with .NET v6 for Visual Studio 2022. This project depends on the `WASimClient_CLI` project (which in turn
depends on `WASimClient` project). The built executable only needs the WASimCommander.WASimClient.dll assembly
(produced by `WASimClient_CLI`) to be present.
