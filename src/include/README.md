# WASimCommander
## WASim API Definitions and Client Components

This directory contains the necessary header files for using the `WASimClient` library or
building a custom client for direct WASimModule (Server) interaction using `WASimAPI`.

The API is designed to be intergrated as part of either a static or dynamic library into other software. 
`WASimClient` is one such implementation, and is available in both static and dynamic forms.
To encourage adaptation, both are dual licensed under the terms of the GPL or LGPL (see LICENSE.txt for details).
